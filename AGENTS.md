# Agent workflow

When working on this repo, prefer the following flow:

- Create a fresh branch named `dev/<short-description>` for each change set.
- Commit all changes to that branch.
- Push the branch to `origin`.
- Open a PR targeting `main`.

Avoid committing directly to `main` or updating existing feature branches unless explicitly requested.
